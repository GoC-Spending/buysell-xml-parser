# buysell-xml-parser

Simple parser to extract contracting data from searches conducted on <https://buyandsell.gc.ca>.

**NB**: The contract history dataset that powers Buyandsell is published by PWGSC/PSPC: <https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/contract-history/download-contract-history-data>. If you want more comprehensive results and finer control over your search terms, itâ€™s probably best to use that dataset directly. If, however, you want just to quickly get the contract metadata for a given search on Buyandsell, this tool will help you do that.
